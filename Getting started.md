After the introduction of the organizers, follow the following steps to get started for xp-days:

1. Ensure you have a connection to the xmpp server. Actually, there are several choices:
   * When you are located in the werewolves room, we have a completly independent setup to limit the dependence on the conference wireless. You can connect to the *awtest* wireless network. Password is *prodata123*. The server is pi.software.wolf. 
   * You can also make use of the conference wifi and use a publicaly available server: awtest1.vm.bytemark.co.uk
1. Make sure you have received 2 accounts for the XMPP server from the organizers. 
   One of these is for use by your bot, the other can be used to manually interact with the game and view the activity.
1. A good way to make sure you understand how the game works is to walk through the manual test procedure - see
1. Choose the technology stack you want to use in this coding contest. 
   There are basic bots available for 
    * [*node.js*](https://github.com/JohanPeeters/softwarewolves-nodejs-player)
    * [*C#*](https://github.com/supernelis/softwarewolves-dotnet-player)
    * [*Ruby*](https://github.com/rwestgeest/sww)
    * [*Java*](https://github.com/supernelis/softwarewolves-java-player).

    But you may also choose to build a bot from the ground up.
1. make sure that your bot uses one of the accounts you received on the correct server, i.e. on *pi.software.wolf*.
