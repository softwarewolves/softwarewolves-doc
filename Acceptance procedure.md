This document describes (manual) acceptance testing.
Use a standard XMPP client such as [Adium][3] or iChat.
You can choose to interact with the game or just observe what the bots are doing by joining a chat room.
You may know the JID of the chat room to join from your bot's logs, 
you may arrange for an invitation to a game around the same time as your, or your competitor's, bot by sending an 'I want to play' message to the game co-ordinator,
or you may arrange for your bot to invite you whenever he is about to do battle.

Acceptance procedure
====================

how to get your software accepted by the business owner:

 1.  Reserve a slot for each story you want to demo
 2.	Show your demo and earn your marks

Reserve a slot for each story
-----------------------------

Inform the business owner about the story/stories you want to demo. _Reservations are closed 5 minutes before the start of each demo session._

Be sure youâ€™re well prepared for the demo, as:
 * You will only have 3 minutes for each scenario.
 * The business owner can be less rewarding in case your demos need multiple trials, fail, or are cancelled.

Show your demo and earn your marks
----------------------------------

You have _at most 3 minutes for each story_. 
It is up to you to convince the business owner you have implemented the story correctly. 

Before the demo starts, agree with the business owner which server to use.
Make sure that your bot is configured accordingly.
The business owner will send an _I want to play_ request to the game co-ordinator via his chat client.
At the same time, you must start your bot.
The behavior of the bot can now be observed in the business owner's chat client.
