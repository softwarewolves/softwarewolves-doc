Werewolves - The Game
=====================

The game follows a night and day cycle. 
* At night, the wolves pick a villager to kill, while everyone else "sleeps". 
* During the day, the villagers wake up and discover that one of them has died, so they will discuss who might be the werewolf. The villagers lynch their guess, hoping it's a wolf. The villagers win if they kill all the wolves; the wolves win if there are the same number of them as villagers.

The following roles can be distinguished:
* Villager – The villager is the simplest role. In the daytime, you vote on who to kill. You try to narrow down who the wolf(s) is/are. 
* Werewolf – The wolf kills one of the villagers during the night. During the day, the Werewolf acts a villager trying to avoid suspicion.
