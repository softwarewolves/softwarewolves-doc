Story acceptance procedure
==========================

This document describes how to get your software accepted by the business owner. The following procedure applies:

 1.  Reserve a slot for each story you want to demo
 2.	Show your demo and earn your marks

Reserve a slot for each story
-----------------------------

Inform the business owner about the story/stories you want to demo. Reservations are closed 5 minutes before the start of each demo session.

Be sure youâ€™re well prepared for the demo, as:
 * You will only have 3 minutes for each scenario.
 * The business owner can be less rewarding in case your demos need multiple trials, fail, or are cancelled.

Show your demo and earn your marks
----------------------------------

You have at most 3 minutes for each story. It is up to you to convince the business owner you have the story implemented correctly.
